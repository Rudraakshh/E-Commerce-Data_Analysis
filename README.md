<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>This project involves the analysis of an e-commerce dataset using SQL for data extraction and Power BI for visualization. The dataset consists of three tables: <code>order_details</code>, <code>order</code>, and <code>salestarget</code>. The goal of this project was to analyze geographical, categorical, sales target, and time-based data, and to use these insights to create an interactive dashboard in Power BI. Additionally, key performance indicators (KPIs) were researched, and forecasting was performed for future profits and amounts earned.</p>
